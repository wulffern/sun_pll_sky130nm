So a single NMOS used to generate a bias voltage like this is a dangerous design. You
should really distribute bias currents. 

I know what I'm doing, and I know that I have to make sure that all NMOS have
IBPSR\_1U as a gate volage needs to have the same ground as my bias transistor. 

It's also important that the bias transistor has the same current direction as
the others.
